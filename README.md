##FAQ

* **What is this 'NBT' you're talking about?**
NBT means 'Named Binary Tag', which is a file format that resemble the well-known XML specification. It is used by Minecraft (and maybe
other programs, who knows?) to store its data, so this format must be efficient and compact. You can't store infinite
world without a little bit of compression, ya know.
All in all, if you don't know what NBT is, then you probably won't need this library.
