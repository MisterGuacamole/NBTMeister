 ABOUT ARRAY TAGS - FROM NBT.txt
 ------------------------------------------------------
 TYPE: 9  NAME: TAG_List
 Payload: TAG_Byte tagId
 		  TAG_Int length
 		  A sequential list of Tags (not Named Tags), of type <typeId>.
 		  The length of this array is <length> Tags
 Notes:   All tags share the same type.
 
 TYPE: 10 NAME: TAG_Compound
 Payload: A sequential list of Named Tags. This array keeps going until a TAG_End is found.
 		  TAG_End end
 Notes:	  If there's a nested TAG_Compound within this tag, that one will also have a TAG_End, so simply reading until the next TAG_End will not work.
		  The names of the named tags have to be unique within each TAG_Compound
 		  The order of the tags is not guaranteed.
 
 ------------------------------------------------------
 ------------------------------------------------------
 ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION
 ------------------------------------------------------
 *************
 Introduction: see the Single.h file for the complete introduction.
 
 **************
 Notes & Usage:
 'Array' is used for representing both Compounds and Lists in the NBT tree.
