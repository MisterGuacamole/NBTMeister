 ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION
 ------------------------------------------------------
 This is the base class for instanciating tags (singles, compounds or lists).
 It exists to permits the arrays types to contains not only singles but also
 all of the other tags, including themselves.
 
 It also contains an attribute that, when get'd from one of the child types, can
 indicate what is the 'qualificator' of the tag ('single', 'compound' or 'list')
 
 N.B.: This class is abstract, hence you cannot directly instantiate it. Indeed, it
 would not make any sense building a 'Tag' without any further information in the
 context of a NBT tree, since every tag has at least one attribute that can differentiate
 it from the other tags (a name, a payload of a certain type, etc.) A 'Tag' without
 a name and a payload cannot exist as an object in the tree for this reason.
